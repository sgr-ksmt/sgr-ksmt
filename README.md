### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Suguru Kishimoto. Please call me su- ðŸ˜Ž  
I have about ten year's experience in an iOS software engineer.  
I've been mainly working at Mercari inc since January 2020.  
<br />
Lately, I've been developing an app with Flutter and Firebase. That's very interesting :star:
